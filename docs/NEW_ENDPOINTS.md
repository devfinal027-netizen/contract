## Enhanced Subscription Creation

The existing **POST /api/subscriptions** endpoint has been enhanced:

- **New Optional Fields**: `pickup_lat`, `pickup_lon`, `dropoff_lat`, `dropoff_lon`
- **Automatic Fare Calculation**: If coordinates are provided, the system:
  1. Calculates distance using Haversine formula
  2. Applies admin-set pricing rules
  3. Updates contract cost with calculated monthly fare (22 working days)
  4. Returns fare calculation details in response

## Pricing Service Utilities

### Distance Calculation
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- Returns distance in kilometers with 2 decimal precision

### Fare Calculation
- Retrieves active pricing rules for contract type
- Applies formula: `base_fare + (distance_km * price_per_km)`
- Ensures minimum fare is met
- Returns detailed breakdown

## User Information Enrichment

All endpoints now include enriched user information:
- **Passenger endpoints**: Include driver details (name, phone, email, vehicle info)
- **Driver endpoints**: Include passenger details (name, phone, email)
- **Trip endpoints**: Include both passenger and driver information
- **Contract endpoints**: Include user details in nested relationships

## Security and Access Control

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based authorization implemented:
  - **Passengers**: Can only access their own data
  - **Drivers**: Can only access their assigned trips/passengers
  - **Admins**: Have full access to all data
- Proper error handling with centralized error middleware

## Database Changes

### New Tables
- `trips` - Individual trip records
- `pricing` - Admin-configurable pricing rules

### Modified Tables
- `subscriptions` - Added `calculated_fare` field for storing fare calculation details

### New Associations
- Trip â†” Contract (N:1)
- Trip â†” Subscription (N:1)

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. The system uses existing user service configuration for user information enrichment.

## Testing

All endpoints can be tested using the provided Postman collection, which has been reorganized into user-type folders:
- ðŸ‘¤ Passenger
- ðŸš— Driver  
- ðŸ›  Admin

Each folder contains relevant authentication and endpoint tests for that user type.
