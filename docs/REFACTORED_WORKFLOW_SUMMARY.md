# Contract Ride Service - Refactored Workflow Summary

## 🎯 **Project Refactoring Complete**

The Contract Ride Service has been successfully refactored to implement a streamlined, subscription-centric workflow that eliminates complexity while maintaining all essential functionality.

## 📋 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
- ✅ **New Subscription Model**: Independent subscriptions with built-in location and pricing data
- ✅ **Contract Settings Model**: Admin-configurable pricing rules per contract type
- ✅ **Removed Dependencies**: Subscriptions no longer require pre-existing contracts

### **2. New Controllers & Services**
- ✅ **Subscription Service**: Automatic fare calculation with distance and pricing logic
- ✅ **New Subscription Controller**: Streamlined create → pay → activate workflow
- ✅ **New Admin Controller**: Contract settings management and driver assignment
- ✅ **New Driver Controller**: Assignment and schedule management with earnings tracking

### **3. Updated API Endpoints**
- ✅ **Passenger Workflow**: 3 simple endpoints for complete subscription management
- ✅ **Admin Workflow**: 4 endpoints for pricing and driver management
- ✅ **Driver Workflow**: 3 endpoints for assignments, schedule, and earnings

### **4. Enhanced Features**
- ✅ **Automatic Fare Calculation**: Distance-based pricing with admin-configurable rates
- ✅ **Built-in Payment Processing**: Integrated payment workflow with status tracking
- ✅ **User Information Enrichment**: All responses include relevant user details
- ✅ **Role-based Security**: Proper access control for all user types

## 🔄 **New Workflow Overview**

    E --> F[Admin Assigns Driver]
    F --> G[Driver Views Assignment]
    G --> H[Service Delivery]
    H --> I[Subscription Completed]
```

## 📊 **Key Improvements**

### **Before (Old System)**
1. Admin creates contract
2. Admin sets pricing manually
3. Passenger subscribes to contract
4. Complex payment processing
5. Manual driver assignment
6. Fragmented user experience

### **After (New System)**
1. **Passenger creates subscription directly** (with automatic fare calculation)
2. **Passenger pays immediately** (streamlined payment)
3. **Admin assigns driver** (simple assignment)
4. **Driver manages assignments** (clear dashboard)
5. **Integrated user experience** (all data enriched)

## 🚀 **New API Endpoints**

### **Passenger Endpoints**
```http
POST /api/subscription/create          # Create + fare estimation
POST /api/subscription/:id/payment     # Process payment
GET  /api/passenger/:id/subscriptions  # View history + active
```

### **Admin Endpoints**
```http
POST /api/admin/contract/settings              # Set pricing rules
GET  /api/admin/contract/settings              # Get pricing rules
POST /api/admin/subscription/:id/assign-driver # Assign driver
GET  /api/admin/subscriptions                  # View all subscriptions
```

### **Driver Endpoints**
```http
GET /api/driver/:id/assignments  # View assigned subscriptions
GET /api/driver/:id/schedule     # View schedule with passenger details
GET /api/driver/:id/earnings     # View earnings summary
```

## 💰 **Fare Calculation System**

### **Formula**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate base fare
baseFare = distance_km × base_price_per_km

// Step 2: Apply discount
discountAmount = baseFare × (discount_percentage ÷ 100)
fareAfterDiscount = baseFare - discountAmount

// Step 3: Ensure minimum fare
dailyFare = Math.max(fareAfterDiscount, minimum_fare)

// Step 4: Apply contract multiplier
multipliers = { DAILY: 1, WEEKLY: 7, MONTHLY: 30, YEARLY: 365 }
finalFare = dailyFare × multipliers[contract_type]
```

### **Example**
- **Route**: Bole Airport → University (6.25 km)
- **Settings**: 25 ETB/km, 10% discount, 50 ETB minimum
- **Contract**: MONTHLY

**Calculation:**
```
Base Fare: 6.25 × 25 = 156.25 ETB
Discount: 156.25 × 10% = 15.63 ETB
After Discount: 156.25 - 15.63 = 140.62 ETB
Daily Fare: max(140.62, 50) = 140.62 ETB
Monthly Fare: 140.62 × 30 = 4,218.60 ETB
```

## 📱 **Updated Postman Collection**
