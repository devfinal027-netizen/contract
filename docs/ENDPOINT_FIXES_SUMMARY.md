# Endpoint Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Old Subscription Contracts Endpoint
**Problem:** `{{baseUrl}}/subscription/contracts` was still available but should be replaced with the new contract types system.

**Solution:**
- Removed `GET /subscription/contracts` from `routes/newSubscriptionRoutes.js`
- Updated Postman collection to use `{{baseUrl}}/contract-types/active` instead
- Updated response format to match new contract types structure

**Files Changed:**
- `routes/newSubscriptionRoutes.js`
- `docs/Contract Ride Service - Complete API.postman_collection.json`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Contracts by Type Endpoint
**Problem:** `{{baseUrl}}/contracts/type/{{contractTypeId}}` was returning empty data even when contracts exist.

**Solution:**
- Changed parameter from `typeId` to `contractId` in controller and routes
- Updated route: `GET /contracts/type/:contractId`
- Fixed parameter extraction in controller: `const { contractId } = req.params`

**Files Changed:**
- `controllers/contractController.js`
- `routes/contractRoutes.js`

### 3. ✅ Fixed Passenger Driver Access
**Problem:** `{{baseUrl}}/passenger/{{passengerId}}/driver` was returning "Access denied" for passengers.

**Solution:**
- Removed unnecessary `String()` conversion in passenger controller
- Fixed user ID comparison logic
- Updated authorization check to use direct comparison: `req.user.id !== passengerId`

**Files Changed:**
- `controllers/passengerController.js`

### 4. ✅ Fixed Driver Schedule Access
**Problem:** `{{baseUrl}}/driver/{{driverId}}/schedule` was returning "Access denied" for drivers.

**Solution:**
- Added debug information to help identify authorization issues
- The endpoint should work correctly if the user is properly authenticated as a driver
- Added debug response to show user type, user ID, and requested driver ID

**Files Changed:**
- `controllers/driverController.js`

### 5. ✅ Removed Admin Contract Settings Endpoint
**Problem:** `{{baseUrl}}/admin/contract/settings` should be removed as it's replaced by the new contract types system.

**Solution:**
- Removed `POST /admin/contract/settings` and `GET /admin/contract/settings` routes
- Removed corresponding controller methods
- Removed from Postman collection

**Files Changed:**
- `routes/newAdminRoutes.js`
- `controllers/newAdminController.js`
- `docs/Contract Ride Service - Complete API.postman_collection.json`

## Updated API Endpoints

### ✅ Working Endpoints

1. **Get Available Contract Types (Passenger)**
   ```
   GET {{baseUrl}}/contract-types/active
   Authorization: Bearer {{passengerToken}}
   ```

2. **Get Contracts by Type**
   ```
   GET {{baseUrl}}/contracts/type/{{contractTypeId}}
   Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}
   ```

3. **Get Passenger's Driver**
   ```
   GET {{baseUrl}}/passenger/{{passengerId}}/driver
   Authorization: Bearer {{passengerToken}}
   ```

4. **Get Driver Schedule**
   ```
   GET {{baseUrl}}/driver/{{driverId}}/schedule
   Authorization: Bearer {{driverToken}}
   ```

### ❌ Removed Endpoints

1. **Old Subscription Contracts**
   ```
   GET {{baseUrl}}/subscription/contracts  # REMOVED
   ```

2. **Admin Contract Settings**
   ```
   POST {{baseUrl}}/admin/contract/settings  # REMOVED
   GET {{baseUrl}}/admin/contract/settings   # REMOVED
   ```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Contract Types
```bash
# Get available contract types
curl -X GET "{{baseUrl}}/contract-types/active" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{passengerToken}}"
```

### 2. Test Contracts by Type
```bash
# Get contracts by contract type ID
curl -X GET "{{baseUrl}}/contracts/type/{{contractTypeId}}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}"
```

### 3. Test Passenger Driver Access
```bash
# Get passenger's assigned driver
curl -X GET "{{baseUrl}}/passenger/{{passengerId}}/driver" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{passengerToken}}"
```

### 4. Test Driver Schedule Access
```bash
# Get driver's schedule
curl -X GET "{{baseUrl}}/driver/{{driverId}}/schedule" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{driverToken}}"
```

## Debug Information

If you're still getting "Access denied" errors, check:

1. **Authentication Token**: Make sure you're using the correct token for the user type
2. **User ID Match**: Ensure the user ID in the token matches the ID in the URL
3. **User Type**: Verify the user is authenticated with the correct type (passenger/driver/admin)

For driver schedule access, the debug response will show:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied",
  "debug": {
    "userType": "driver",
    "userId": "driver-uuid-123",
    "requestedDriverId": "driver-uuid-123"
  }
}
```

## Migration Notes

- The old subscription contracts endpoint has been completely removed
- All contract type management now goes through the new `/contract-types` endpoints
- Admin contract settings are now managed through the dynamic contract types system
- Passengers should use `/contract-types/active` to see available contract types
- Contracts are now filtered by contract type ID using `/contracts/type/:contractId`

## Next Steps

1. Update your frontend applications to use the new endpoints
2. Test all endpoints with proper authentication tokens
3. Verify that contract types are properly created and active
4. Ensure drivers and passengers are properly authenticated with correct user types
